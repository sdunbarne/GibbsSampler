# GibbsSampler
Section 12 of a tentative books on Markov chains with examples of application of Gibbs sampling.

The Gibbs sampler is an algorithm for generating random
variables from a marginal distribution indirectly, without
having to calculate the density.  Gibbs sampling is based only
on elementary properties of Markov chains.
    
The simple case of a \( 2 \times 2 \) table with multinomial
sampling clearly illustrates the Markov chain nature of the
process.
    
The simple case of a bivariate normal table with Gibbs sampling
clearly illustrates Gibbs sampling for continuous distributions.

A simple Bayesian model for a spam filter illustrates typical
Gibbs sampling.
